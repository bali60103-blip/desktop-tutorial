"""A routable pedestrian graph built from the extracted OSM ways.

Why this exists: counting "ways that cross the axis" is unreliable, because a
smoothed centreline gets clipped by parallel sidewalk fragments, and because
railway/subway ways cross the axis without carrying a single pedestrian. A
graph answers the only question that matters — *can a person actually walk
from the north side to the south side, and how far do they have to go?*

Notes on Taipei OSM: sidewalks are usually mapped as separate
highway=footway ways that touch the carriageway only at
footway=crossing ways. Junction connectivity therefore comes from shared node
ids, which is why stage 1 kept every way's full node-ref list.
