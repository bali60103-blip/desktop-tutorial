"""Compute the real north/south values that seed tools/boundary_comparison.html.

That tool shipped with six 示意 (illustrative) numbers. This script replaces the
ones that are actually measurable with values traceable to OSM objects, and is
explicit about the ones that are NOT measurable from any data we hold.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT WILL NOT DO: invent a number for 連鎖品牌店占比, 建物樓齡,
騎樓型態一致度 or 認知地圖邊界. Those need brand/age datasets or fieldwork we do
not have. They are emitted with value None so the tool renders them as blanks
for the user to fill, rather than as plausible-looking fiction.

READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THE TOOL'S SCORE. The 分界性指數 is the mean relative
north/south difference. measure_industry.py showed that framing is not
sufficient evidence of severance: the north/south difference across 市民大道
(JS 0.213) sits INSIDE the range produced by placebo lines drawn 300–450 m away
entirely on one side (0.145–0.263). A high score on this tool means "the two
sides differ", which in a dense city is true of any two adjacent strips. For
whether the road CAUSES the divide, see tools/civic_blvd_severance.html.
